### WHO report says animals are likely source of COVID-19

-City where COVID 19 was first detected - Wuhan
-Four scenarios in order of likelihood for the emergence of the new coronavirus
	-Transmission from bats through another animal - likely to very likely
    -Direct spread from bats to humans - likely
	-To humans from the packaging of “coldchain” food products - possible but not likely. 
	-Last possibility was previously dismissed by the WHO

-Bats are known to carry coronaviruses
-The closest relative of the virus that causes COVID 19 has been found in bats. However, the report says that “the evolutionary distance between these bat viruses and (COVID 19) is estimated to be several decades, suggesting a missing link.”
-Report said highly similar viruses have been found in pangolins, but scientists have yet to identify the same coronavirus in animals that has been infecting humans
